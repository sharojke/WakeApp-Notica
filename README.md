## My Participation


It was my first commercial project that I developed in a team with other people.

### Responsibilities

First of all, I had to fully immerse myself in the working atmosphere, as well as study the code style, company libraries and technologies.  
I was in a team with my mentor and worked on the project from January to February 2021, after that the work on the project was completed.

## Functionality


The main functionality described below ***was implemented by me or with my active participation***.  
Of course, in addition to this, a lot of small tasks have been completed and a lot of bugs have been fixed.

### Viewing a Note

#### Tag and Background

Adding a tag and changing the color gave the note uniqueness.  
The views that appeared for selection were written programmatically, which gave some complexity.

#### Bulleted List

A lot of work has been done with NSAttributedString and NSRange. In this case, the bullet was a regular utf-symbol.  
Another problem was saving the note in the form in which the user made it. Fortunately, we can save NSAttributedString to Realm and the problem is gone.

Logic was also written to add new types of bullets. Unfortunately, the work on the project was completed without adding new types.

### Recently Deleted

Each deleted note was moved to "Recently Deleted".  
There the user could permanently delete the note or restore it. 30 days after the deletion, the notes were deleted themselves.
